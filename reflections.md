## Week 6

10/10/2022 - 21 hours

#### Tasks Completed
* All the Checkpoint 1 Deliverables
    * Online research to get an idea for how my app can be necessary, different, or similar to websites providing similar services.  In my findings, there's really only one website, basicmusictheory.com, that does something comparable to what I have in mind for my project.  
    * Problem Statement
    * User Stories
    * Application Flow
    * Technologies I will be using
    * A Project Plan
    * Screen Designs/Wireframes  

Right now I think I have an understanding in how my application will work, though I'm sure there will be some changes down the road.  I really had to think about the application flow - how my project will "work" with the newer technologies I've learned (Hibernate, DAOs, relationships between database tables).  Having an example like Fat Bike Trails is a huge help.  Some unknowns thus far, like authentication/authorization capabilities, and what/how to use an API in Java, make the project planning a little challenging.
