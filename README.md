# Bill Georgeson Individual Project 

This repository will contain all files for the MusicTheoryRepo Individual Project, Enterprise Java Fall 2022.

### Problem Statement

For musicians or anyone who has taken up introductory music theory, there are very few Internet resources that provide a centralized representation of basic music theory references, such as lists for music keys, key scales, key chords, modes, and relevant songs.  It would be a helpful learning tool for novice music theory enthusiasts to have a website/web app that serves as a comprehensive reference point for basic music theory information.  I would like to build a website, musictheoryrepository.com, that can satisfy those requirements.
