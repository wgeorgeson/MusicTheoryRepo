### Problem Statement

Bartenders, bar/tavern professionals, and public users can use a Web-based, centralized resource to quickly assist them in 
the preparation of cocktails for customers and friends.  This application can help expedite this process by providing an 
intuitive interface for quickly and easily searching for and locating drink recipes.
